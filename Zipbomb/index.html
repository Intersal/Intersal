<h1 style="text-align: center;">Zip Bomb</h1>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">This zip file uncompresses into roughly <b>159,515,611,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quettabytes</b> or 188,322,793,720,218,122,403,985,752,064,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 gigabytes.<br>
For scale a one gram black hole is 4.78 gigabytes and a supermassive black hole is
1,989,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 grams makes
9,507,420,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 gigabytes which is 9,507,420,000,000,000,610,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes which is only 9,507,420,000,000 quettabytes <b>0.000000000000005048%</b> of my zip bomb. <br>
For context someone made a zip bomb that was 10^50 bytes.<br>
The most famous zip bomb named 42.zip is 42 kilobytes and uncompresses to 4.2 petabytes, not even a grain of sand compaired to mine.<br>
The second largest ive seen was 55.4 Yottabytes<br>
The number one ive seen was around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32UERlUE9lc" target="_blank">4,140,023,250,000,000 quettabytes</a>, which is a lot but <b>not nearly enough to match <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXAd6z7YYIk" target="_blank">my zip bomb</a>.</b></p>

    <img class="center" src="graph.png" alt="Graph of the zip bomb size">

    <p>Oh right, its only <b>7.4 megabytes</b>.<br>
    Thats ~<b>2,548,346,329,096,321,006,819,834,263,382,949,932,341,001,353,179,972,936.40054127198917456</b>% bigger</p>
    <p>Its name is "﷽.zip" because ﷽ is the largest character and I believe it is quite fitting.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>TLDR: <br> Big zip bomb. I have world record.</p>
    <p>Btw this is quite small compaired to <a href="Zip bomb.html">This one</a>.</p>
