    <h1>My Blog</h1>
    <p>Hello! I've been thinking of making something like this for a while. I'm mostly writing this for myself but I think it'd be unfair if I only shared it with myself. So, I've decided to keep a blog about realizations I make so I don't forget, and you can be inspired!</p>
    <p>At the time of writing this I've fallen from grace T^T. But I'm not giving up! Just knowing how it felt to live every day like it was the best day of my life. I really hope to whoevers reading this that you appreciate everything thats been given to you. <b>truly</b>.</p>

    <h2>Why Love?</h2>
    <p>Love is something that I think is the most important thing in life. I think that if everyone loved each other, the world would be a much better place. I think that love is the most powerful force in the universe. I think that love is what makes life worth living. I think that love is what makes us human.</p>
    <p>And I know, of course Love is what makes us human and that I'm only stating the obvious. But, I dont see many people who actually believe it. Sometimes the most obvious and overdone lessons are the least used.</p>

    <div class="quote">
      When searching for a land of green grass with dewdrops, 68 degree air with a light breeze wafting through and a light sun beaming on you but not too harshly. most people roam the lands in search of paradise but they'll never find it, because its right beneath their feet.
